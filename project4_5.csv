20,Female,13,Internet,Unrealistic standards,The ability to access everything and anything at any given moment raises one's standards and therefore makes many other things feel lacking,"Unusual standards pushed onto others only escalates into a high pressure society, in which the feeling of disappoint or inferiority could only build",Comfort,The ability to see/experience everyone’s creativity,The society that came with it,Loss of individuality,Discouragement of emotions,Internet
19,Female,13,Social media,Increased comparisons,"It takes up a lot of time away from real life and gives a lot of unrealistic depictions of how things are in life, like body image for example",Now with better technology and communication you see way more people than you could before and may compare yourself a lot to them,I like being able to see different people I would never see normally,Cars,I don’t like microplastics,Men,Trauma from parents,Social media

18,Male,12,Survival necessity end,Social illusionary widening,"When I think about this question, I begin to consider the growth of humanity across a broad timeline. As we improve as a collective, we find less of the need to invest energy into crucial tasks and expend it into less taxing ones. Eventually, we have reached an era where the human body no longer exists to survive and hunt",but instead stays alive to maintain its societal ranking. There is such a broad scope of humanity as a whole available for everybody to see; especially as we transcend deeper into the digital age…to a point where we become a hivemind and become subtly forced to appeal towards things we are truly not passionate about.,My favorite thing about the modern human life is the fact that we no longer live each day for the sole purpose of survival: a huge leap from the technologically inferior species that live each day in a gruesome walk between life and death.,My second-favorite thing about the modern human life is the diversification of cultures  to create truly unique bubbles within humanity that enrich our lives. One such example is a truly distinct taste in music.,"My least-favorite thing about the modern human life is the realization that I was a generation away from living another kind of life with childhood friends and playing outside until sunset. Perhaps modernity is a bad thing past a certain point. As Don Marquis wrote in the lesson of the moth, ""we are like human beings used to be before they became too civilized to enjoy themselves"", ""we"" referring to another species.","I cannot speak for any other mother except my own. However, I understand my mother's will for her children to grow up as responsible individuals and believe in the same things she does. As society becomes increasingly diverse, a mother cannot do anything but fear for what her children may grow up into. I'm sure the image of what my mother thought I would become is very different compared to who I am today. (Fear of the outcome of individual)","Associated with the head of the family is a livable wage. I was fortunate to grow up with a middle-class family and live a comfortable life, but I know of many stories besides mine where families are nowhere near as able to care for their children due to money. The terrifying thought of being unable to supply for your family is one that I think is especially devastating today. (Fear of inability to supply for family)","This question realistically has one answer, being the internet. This extraordinary technology has exposed us to a whole new system of applying social capital across countless bubbles of likeminded people. Not only can this be devastating to our mental, but corporations looking to monetize off of the users of the internet deploy sinister tactics that result in horrible symptoms. Addiction is serious, and the internet is the culprit. (The internet)"

19,Female,13,Stress of school,Covid's stunted socialization,"For me the stress of school was a major factor in my mental health decline. I think the effect of this depends on the area, because where I primarily grew up, Northern Virginia, I feel compared to other places I’ve lived, had a much worse culture surrounding educational and work performance. You have to compete with others constantly for the best scores, take the best classes, and if you’re not, you’re not good enough. That suffering and stress is also kind of a shared experience sometimes necessary among certain cliques. That stress obviously would lead to mental health problems.","I think another leading cause of mental illness was the stunted socialization we all experienced as a result of covid. I’ve personally had a hard time making new friends, and sometimes keeping connections with old friends, since the pandemic. I’ve also showed more symptoms of germophobia since the pandemic, but I think that might be a bit more rare, because not many people are actually still wearing masks.","My favorite thing is probably how easy it is to keep in touch with people. My great grandfather died in WWII, and the last letter he sent to my great grandmother was months before his death. People who are as close as across the street and as far as across the globe are just on instant message away.","I like how much easier it is to store mass amounts of media now than it was in the past. I had VHS when I grew up, and to think you could only fit one, maybe two, episodes of a TV series on those. Now, I can fit several tv series on an external 5TB harddrive. I like that I can scan old photos, and rip old DVDs, and save them all in one place.","What I don’t like about modern human life is probably just how overstimulating it is. There’s advertisements bombarding you at every second, and cars running down the street, and whatnot. I’m not as sensitive to certain sounds and smells as certain people but I definitely feel in modern times, even in suburban and rural areas, everything has gotten a lot more overwhelming.","The pressure to both work and raise children. Sometimes, even just the pressure to raise children.",Pressure to perform in work,"Pressure to perform in school, not only academically but socially"
